        <p class="margin-bottom">The Stem Initiative, spearheaded by Teq, is intended to create a cost-effective sustainable STEM Program for NYC educators and students. We ask you to enlist the help of your local elected officials, through Reso A funding, to provide a consistent set of tools, the Teq Mobile STEM Labs, as the core of the program.</p>
        <p class="margin-bottom">Teq STEM Lab provides cost-effective, turn-key teaching platforms designed to make technology use in the classroom as easy as it can be, making students more productive and teachers more efficient. The ultimate goal of the stem initiative is to produce a highly competent, STEM-based professional workforce, which is currently lacking, not only in New York but in our country as a whole. We seek to transform the way science, technology, engineering, art, and math education is delivered in the 5 boroughs, by providing all your teachers access to the latest STEM teaching tools and a Professional Development program to support them.</p>
